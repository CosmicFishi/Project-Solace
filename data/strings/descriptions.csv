#Factions,,,,,,
projectsolace,FACTION,"Formally a group of survivors of the Second AI war, some are scientists, some are technicians banding together to outlive the day. There were only a few of us but as time went on, the group numbers kept rising and so, they set out to the empty vast space for one purpose only, finding a place where they can protect themself and others like them from the horror of what is known as the Sector. They called themself “Solace” as it is their purpose, to keep peace and help those in need.
10 cycles after the Second AI war, while exploring around the outer part of the core Sector, a distress signal appeared on the main screen of a Solace’s cruiser, without hesitation, the group headed toward the system where the signal was located. Expected pirates to appear right away after the system jump, the cruiser was ready for combat but there were no ships and not a single wreckage in sight, how odd. Following that signal closer, they encounter an abandoned and lost scientist, Dr Wold who becomes one of our greatest researchers for his discovery of the Solace core.
The Solace crystal core or the Solace core as many people called it, is a crystal like object which can only be found in the Chilka system, after being researched extensively by Dr Wold, it unexpectedly has a wide range of powerful quirks. With this discovery, the core becomes a symbol for the Solace Association as it is the power, a tool to maintain peace in the Sector. With that, the faction becomes a threat that can not be taken lightly when it comes to military force. 
Nowadays, the faction welcomes people all over the Sector, as long as they contribute to the greater good, the Association does not care about who they are and what they did, if they are willing to lend a hand, they will always be accepted.

enmity,FACTION,"After the successful initial establishment of the Solace Association in the Chilka home system, exploration divisions were formed in search for technology that can aid in the return of past industrial advancements. Hundreds of squadrons were spread out to all nearby systems in search for the tools to do so, as well as scout and document systems for future expansion if needed.
Numerous reports were sent back as the expedition went on, one in particular that stood out was the discovery of a planet filled with autonomous entities, dubbed ""Kearsarge"". Informed of this extraordinary news, an expedition for this planet was set with major participants of both military and research departments. Shortly after, an outpost was formed there with the main focus on researching the behavior of entities and the possibility of utilizing such tech.
It was not long until intel spread into Tri-Tachyon Headquarters and the Hegemony as they arm armadas to confirm whether the rumors of such entities were indeed correct or heinous.
First encounter near the outer gate of the system was a Tri-Tachyon Corporation blockade, demanding immediate surrender of ownership of the system, or else.
Receiving such a frightful threat, Solace Association calls for aid from the Sector but only the Hegemony answered. As the Hegemony armada begins its journey to reach Kearsarge, the Tri-Tachyon have already given out signs of engagement. Without much option, first few prototypes of the Strafer tech were used combined with reinforcements from couples of Solace Association squadrons in order to turn the tide. Victory triumphed but without heavy losses on both sides.
Receiving intel of the engagement, the Hegemony Executive Council can no longer ignore such matters. As the armadas reach Ayubia, Kearsarge’s system, Dr.Wold and many Solace representatives manage to arrange a meeting with the High Hegemon and the Hegemony Executive Council where they reach a compromise in the future of Kearsarge. By the end of the meeting, an autonomous dog-like entity was arranged to be presented to the Hegemony as a proof that Solace Association and the soon to be founded Enmity Strafters can indeed govern such technology.
Not long after, Enmity Strafters was established as an ally of the Solace Association who will govern over the protection as well as regulation of such Strafer tech.

#fighters,,,,,,
ps_sooty,SHIP,"Constructed from the remains of a Terminator Drone, this prototype was developed by the Solace Association to aid the air support in large engagements. Rumors about the AI core within due to its complex movement still is a mystery to many officers.",,,,
ps_riveti,SHIP,"Inspired by the Broadsword class, the Riveti class was built as a front liner for fighter engagement. Flying with it, fighters can easily maneuver through the heavy fire and blast the enemy with ease.",,,,
ps_viridis,SHIP,"As a direct upgrade to its brother Riveti class, the Viridis is equipped with heavier armament to further the original role that it was given. Despite the fragile look, the Viridis class can pack a punch and more if there are enough of them on the field.",,,,
ps_tigris,SHIP,"Built to constantly deal damage to the enemy ship, the Tigris class fighter is a foe that not many prefer to fight against. With its gravitation beam, the Tigris class can easily knock down opponents' shields without any effort.",,,,
ps_dumerili,SHIP,"Agile yet deadly, the Dumerili class is the spear of engagement. Equipped with a phase lance, it can easily shred through any layers of armors given enough time and number.",,,,
ps_vudii,SHIP,"Heavily loaded with enough armament to take out a frigate on its own, the Vudii class is a cruel and terrifying foe for whenever it is deployed on the battlefield.",,,,
,,,,,,
#Ships,,,,,,
#frigates,,,,,,
ps_salawesi,SHIP,"A ship that is made for the sole purpose of keeping the line of the fleet, capable of fending off enemy ships while having good flux capacity and dissipation stat.",,,,
ps_taliabu,SHIP,"One of the first frigate to get a fighter bay built in, the Taliabu is a agile yet fearsome ship with the capability of moving swiftly on the battlefield. Even though the ship is quite low on the armament side, the fighter bay helps the frigate tremendously in one to one and large battle. Taliabu class can be fit into two role, a support carrier with bomber or a brawler with interceptors wings.",,,,
ps_tanimbar,SHIP,"Combining the intellect of our brilliant scientists as well as the strength of the Solace core, the Tanimbar class frigate is one of the first successful experiments which revolutionized the Solace’s military capability. Swift and agile, the ship can easily maneuver in the battlefield to engage and destroy those who wander away from their lines.",,,,
ps_laevis,SHIP,"The first generation of the Enmity task force, Laevis class was forged using the technology only available on the Kearsarge as a first response to any threats. Focusing on long range engagement, the ship class was built to handle fighters while putting pressure on the enemy with long distance beaming. However, duo to the ship modifications, the Laevis can be quite fragile as it doesn't perform well once it is separated from the fleet.",,,,
,,,,,,
#destroyers,,,,,,
ps_morepork,SHIP,"Aggressive and agile, those are the two advantages of this ship. Having a large hardpoint mount on it, the Morepork class destroyer can pack some heavy punches to crush those who dare to stand against it. However, this destroyer doesn’t have very good flux stat which means mounting heavy flux weapons can overload the ship easily.",,,,
ps_ashy,SHIP,"The Ashi class is a flexible destroyer, it can serve multiple roles such as liner, tank or demolisher. With four medium mounts and decent stats, the ship can perform above the average destroyer ships. Due to the ship’s loadout as well as the heavy armors covered all over it, the ship suffers from poor maneuverability and speed.",,,,
ps_papuan,SHIP,"As the first generation of carrier, the Papuan class ship is relatively small but quite deadly when it comes to bombarding the target in long distant combat. With two fighter bays on the ship combining the ship system which can increase the number of fighters, Papuan will effortlessly demolish the enemy line before they can even react to it. However, due to the nature of carrier ship class, the ship is quite fragile and so, it needs support in the front line to push back the enemy in order for Papuan to perform its destructive role.",,,,
ps_pricei,SHIP,"After the success of the Laevis frigate carrier, Pricei was built as a direct upgrade of its predecessor. Handling two fighter bays and having two front facing medium mounts, the Pricei class can give the enemy line quite the pounding while still being defended by its small mounts scattered around the hull. Despite the immense pressure, the ship class is quite lacking when it comes to armor which has become its biggest weakness.",,,,
,,,,,,
#cruisers,,,,,,
ps_barking,SHIP,"One of the first generation of the Solace’s cruiser class, the ship is mounted with heavy armaments that can easily push the enemy back from their advance. Four hardpoint missiles provide the ship with an incredible amount of control over the battlefield as well as fitting up multiple roles if used correctly.",,,,
ps_rufous,SHIP,"Fearless and destructive, the Rufous class with a large turret mount can easily break through the enemy line and provide amazing cover fire with its four medium mounts. Despite having that large loadout, the ship is surprisingly sharp which means it can engage and disengage the opponent with ease.",,,,
ps_javanica,SHIP,"The Javanica class is a fearful opponent for those who rely on missiles or fighters to deal blows. With its ship system, the ship fires multiple tracking rockets dealing damage to the projectile's surrounding area when traveling,  easily disabling most of the torpedoes or fighters heading toward the ship.
However, the ship can't perform well on its own since the ship loadout is quite limited but in a team fight, Javanica can easily be the key ship to push the enemy back to their line.
",,,,
ps_aurantia,SHIP,"When it comes to long range support, the aurantia class is the perfect ship that comes to mind for Solace’s officers. With one large missile mount strapped to the front of the ship, the Aurantia class utilized its fighters as the main source of damage and its ship system to do burst bombing drive by to nearby enemy. The Auratia class can be the key ship to disable the target for an easy kill or strike down heavily armored enemies. 
However, due to it being a carrier, the ship is limited by its firepower and that can be quite a big downfall when the fighters are out.",,,,
ps_merkeri,SHIP,"Despite being a carrier cruiser, the Merkeri ship class can pack quite the heavy punch while maneuvering around the battlefield. Handling a large mount built right at the center of the hull,  the ship class can be fitted into many roles, from long range bombardment using bombers to close line brawler. With that in mind, the Merkeri lacks the specialization that many have so it can be challenging to fit up.",,,,
ps_alitha,SHIP,"“May day, may day, this is the captain of the #$S ##$#$# speaking. We are requesting help immediately as we suffered heavy losses after the last engagement with an unknown #$%### in a neutron system. Our engines were taken ## #$#%... the entity's large magnetic-like w##pons and our supplies won’t #$$#....#$## longer. There was signs of sentient lifeform aboard the ship as our bio-detector retu#$####........” - Unknown captain, log recovered from salvage.

The log turned static.",,,,
ps_oculatus,SHIP,"Biometric scanner indicates high chance of phase cloak tech used on the cruiser but it didn’t explain the abnormal electric field surrounding the ship. Further inspection with the boarding team inside the ship displays significant technology advancement compared to the current Sector tech level, which further establishes that the ship indeed comes from a time before now.",,,,
,,,,,,
#capitals,,,,,,
ps_camiguin,SHIP,"“One of a kind”, that is the nickname of the Camiguin capital ship. As the first generation of Solace’s capital ship, the Camiguin class ‘armament can rival any opponent facing it with four large mounts. Despite its size, the ship can maneuver easily on the battlefield, plus having two large missiles, this capital can quickly finish the enemy before facing another one.",,,,
ps_nadhmor,SHIP,"As a parting gift from the old alliance, the Nadhmore class blueprint was given to the Solace Association as a symbol of friendship. Upon analyzing the ship class, our brilliant scientists have discovered some major flaws as well as downgrades that keep the ship from its best performance. Realizing those mistakes, the ship class has been overhauled and pushed to its limit.
Receiving the blessing from the Solace crystal, Nadhmor now becomes even deadlier. With its 2 large mounts, it can easily down any shield or wreck through any armor with the correct build. However, the ship has to replace some of its armor for more firepower focus, resulting in lower armor than the original form.
",,,,
ps_albertine,SHIP,"A rather unique looking capital ship is what others say about the Albertine battlecarrier when they first see them. Without a doubt, this is the Solace’s fleet base of operation for the one that leads the squadron. Packed with more than enough fighter bay to support the frontline combined with the ship’s two large hybrid mounts, the Albertine carrier can act as a frontline support tank and simultaneously send out fighters deep into the enemy line. It is a fearsome foe to deal with and should be the number one priority when fighting. 
However, with its encumbersome body, the ship can be quite slow to maneuver and with its fighter on refit, the ship can be an easy target for larger foes.",,,,
ps_ravus,SHIP,"The proud of Enmity or as some may refer, the Champion of shredding, those are titles that have been given to the Ravus battle carrier class. Having two built in particle shredders, the ship can easily pierce through the heavy armor layers and deliver the killing blow in an instant. Combine that with its fighters, the Ravus class is the anchor that finishes the enemy while holding the  engagement line between Enmity and those who oppose them.",,,,
ps_sarpedon,SHIP,"“How come such mistakes happened, HOW COME THE SU#JE#T ESCAPED A####? …Sigh, deploy the #$#$##. Clean this #$## $#.Time is not in our favor right no##% aaaaaAAAAAAAAA####%##.............” - Former Tritachyon Executive, leaked messages.",,unknow,,

ps_cuttingsalvo,SHIP_SYSTEM,Reload one burst for all missiles mounted and force fire them.,,,,
ps_condensedblink,SHIP_SYSTEM,Short length blink.,,,,
,,,,,,
#Weapons,,,,,,
ps_tragopo,WEAPON,"A fast but powerful firing cannon focused on burst firing combined with a medium range, it can easily break through heavily shielded or thick armored enemies. However, due to the nature of burst firing, the gun’s flux efficiency isn’t that great compared to other similar burst fire guns.",,,,
ps_carthami,WEAPON,"To deal with bulky armored enemies, Carthami cannon was developed to break through any layers of armor that the opponent has no matter the thickness. Combined with its three burst firing, the cannon is a fearsome solution to many ships that dare to stand before it",,,,
ps_porri,WEAPON,"A medium range missile designed for burst damage delivery while having some EMP damage to disable any electric devices in the impact area. Even though the weapon has a large size magazine, the damage type is energy therefore it won’t do well against bulky opponents.",,,,
ps_proteolyticbeam,WEAPON,"As one of Enmity biggest breakthroughs when it comes to fabricating armament, our scientists have discovered a way to condense down particles into a continuous beam that can pierce through any layers of armor or to almost instantly remove a ship from existence.",,,,
ps_acris,WEAPON,"Once forgotten technology resurrected into a tool for mass eradication, packed into a decent size for maximum efficiency and rapid removal.",,,,
ps_anaxyr,WEAPON,"Endless stream of ammunition floods into the chamber as the hatches open up ready for the show of a lifetime. As the warheads launched into the vast space, trillions of nano-sized workers rushed into the factory to start assembling fatal replacements.",,,,

,,,,,,
#Planets,,,,,,
ps_eliavouvou,CUSTOM,"The founding place for the Solace Association, discovered many cycles ago in an expedition seeking for a suitable heaven for all that needed help. A lush and verdant biosphere combined with warm air and water made for the perfect place to settle in. Due to the ever growing immigrant population, the planet quickly turned into an agriculture focused to support the mass daily needs. Quickly after the initial population boom, other industries settled in as well, from refining to light industry. As cycles passed, Elia Vouvou quickly became the base of expansion for the settlement of other planets in the system as well as headquarters for the military to defend against the pirates.",,,,
ps_methusalah,CUSTOM,"Further inspection on the surrounding planets has proven the system's worth as Methuselah is the perfect place for self-sustaining fuel productions and rare mineral mining. Not long after the expedition fleets reached the planet, facilities were built to maintain, manufacture and ship the endless fuel productions to all places in the system and in the Sector.",,,,
ps_tjikko,CUSTOM,"With the ever growing threats outside the Chilka system, a dedicated militaristic stronghold is a must. Glowing fissures and active volcanos did not stop Solace from conquering as Tjikko has the perfect condition to build an impenetrable fortress. Unstable as the planet is, the economy however, benefits a lot from the erratic. Rich ore deposits and spare rare ores make the perfect foundation for self-sustaining metal and transplutonic productions. ",,,,
ps_staramaslina,CUSTOM,"A barren world it seems, yet somehow, Solace Association has transformed it into homes for a population of hundreds thousand. A combination of militaristic and industrial facilities was built on the planet to serve as the second line of defense and economy. ",,,,
ps_bowditch,CUSTOM,"Just couples of light years away from Kearsarge, lies Bowditch, Enmity industrial and militaristic manufacturer. Dry and dusty as the planet seems, the inner layers contain a significant amount of deposits which have been utilized fully combined with refining facilities dots all over the globe, Bowditch is meant to become the powerhouse of Enmity.",,,,
ps_kearsarge,CUSTOM,"Rumors about the abnormal lifeform on the planet have attracted much unwanted attention from the Tri-tachyon, yet the Enmity Strafter guards the planet as its protector. Discovered in the industrial expedition, the Solace has granted Kearsarge to Enmity with the head of technology leading the faction the responsibility to protect as well as maintain the current balance in the Sector. Many cycles after the initial Enmity establishment, Kearsarge turned into a sanctuary for all the abnormal lifeforms present on the planet. Though, suspicions about the technology held by the Enmity still circles around the Sector.",,,,
ps_malleus,CUSTOM,Radiation from the nearby star ravaged the surface of this world due to the lack of atmosphere is the perfect place for Hegemony to establish a small outer Sector watcher.,,,,
