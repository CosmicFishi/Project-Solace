ps_taliabu,SHIP,"The foundation ship of Solace Association. With a medium hardpoint mount, it can perform extremely well for a frigate size ship. The ship is also covered with thick layers of armor that can take a punch while giving out even harder hits.",,,,

#destroyers,,,,,,
ps_morepork,SHIP,"Aggressive and agile, those are the two advantages of this ship. Having a large hardpoint mount on it, the Morepork class destroyer can pack some heavy punches to crush those who dare to stand against it. However, this destroyer doesn’t have very good flux stat which means mounting heavy flux weapons can overload the ship easily.",,,,
ps_ashy,SHIP,"The Ashi class is a flexible destroyer, it can serve multiple roles such as liner, tank or demolisher. With four medium mounts and decent stats, the ship can perform above the average destroyer ships. Due to the ship’s loadout as well as the heavy armors covered all over it, the ship suffers from poor maneuverability and speed.",,,,

#cruisers,,,,,,
ps_barking,SHIP,"One of the first generation of the Solace’s cruiser class, the ship is mounted with heavy armaments that can easily push the enemy back from their advance. Four hardpoint missiles provide the ship with an incredible amount of control over the battlefield as well as fitting up multiple roles if used correctly.",,,,
ps_rufous,SHIP,"Fearless and destructive, the Rufous class with a large turret mount can easily break through the enemy line and provide amazing cover fire with its four medium mounts. Despite having that large loadout, the ship is surprisingly sharp which means it can engage and disengage the opponent with ease.",,,,
